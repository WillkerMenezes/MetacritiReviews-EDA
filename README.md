## Description
[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com) is a platform for reviewing games, movies, TV shows and musics.

Using the ["Metacritic Scores for Games, Movies, TV & Music" dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patkle/metacritic-scores-for-games-movies-tv-and-music), 
we have generate insights about the the correlation between the parameters and their influence over the scores given by the platform and the users.

## Gettins Started
You can try this code on your own by opening google colab, and chossing "File"> "Open notebook" > "GitHub" and inserting the URL for this project. Then you only need to select the notebook file that is shown there.

## Tools
Python,
Pandas,
Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pyplot)

## Improvements and Reviews
- Finish the analysis on other types of media and entertainment
- There are few useful parameters for trying to create a predictive model for the scores, it would be good to collect more features.

## Notes
This project was initially developed during ADA's Data Science Path course - Programming Techniques module (EDA with Data Visualization),
along with collaborators.
